# UnityVoxelRaytracer
A demo that raytraces voxels in a compute shader on the GPU. For educational purposes. I made it in the summer of 2019. It can render millions of voxels efficiently. The following screenshots were made while it run at 60FPS on a middle range GTX 1660Ti Card. To be clear it doesn't use RTX extensions, but compute shaders. Ray tracing is implemented manually.
